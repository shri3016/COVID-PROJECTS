"THE NEW NORMAL"

![alternate text](https://blogsmedia.lse.ac.uk/blogs.dir/35/files/2020/05/social-distancing-5132570_1280.png)

Consider a workplace where a person is assigned to check the temperature using thermal scanners, but with this project we are going to eliminate them, and it will automatically get checked. At the entry there will be a face scanner along with the thermal cameras, if the person wearing mask is given a green signal then the thermal camera will check the temperature, and in the workplace people who donâ€™t follow social distancing will enclosed in red box as per the code and that would be deployed in the security cameras, the same can be used in streets as well.
